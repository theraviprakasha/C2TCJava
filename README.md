# FSWD Course Programs by Ravi Prakasha

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that I've learned during my Full Stack Web Development (FSWD) course with the C2TC program held by TNSIF. These programs cover various topics in Java programming, and I've organized them into directories for easy access and reference.

## Program Directories

- [Abstraction]([https://github.com/theraviprakasha/C2TCJava/tree/main/Java](https://github.com/theraviprakasha/C2TCJava/tree/main/Java/Abstraction))


## How to Use and Run the Programs

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   To get started, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/theraviprakasha/C2TCJava.git


2. **Navigate to a Specific Program:**

Each program is located in its respective directory within the repository. Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run:

cd C2TCJava/Java/Abstraction


3. **Compile and Run the Java Program:**

To compile a Java program, you can use the `javac` command followed by the Java file's name (with the `.java` extension). For example:

javac MyJavaProgram.java


To run the compiled Java program, use the `java` command followed by the class name (without the `.class` extension). For example:

java MyJavaProgram



4. **Follow Program-Specific Instructions:**

Some programs may have specific instructions or README files within their respective directories. Be sure to check for any additional setup or usage instructions provided for each program.
